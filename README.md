# PyStoreGen
A GUI based software using Python and its Libraries to Generate and Suggest a strong password and store them in Offline mode after the Encryption using Modified Substitution Algorithm along with Salting.

main.py can be used to run the program.
Rest supporting files are in res folder written in Python.

The project uses Tkinter as Python GUI Library to create the GUI of the software.

Pyperclip library of Python has been used inorder to copy the password to the clipboard. (No need to change the window again and again to write the password ;P ).
Modified Substitution Algorithm has been implemented by a different logic so as to make it next to crack the password. 
Along with that salting has been used to make use of hash tables impossible.

Global Password is created and is also stored in Encrypted form for two factor security.
